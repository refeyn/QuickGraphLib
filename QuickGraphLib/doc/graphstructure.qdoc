\title Graph structure
\brief The basics of how a graph is constructed

\section1 Top-level graph structure

Basic graphs usually consist of an X axis, a Y axis and a graphing area where the data is displayed. In QuickGraphLib, this structure is expressed in QML using a 2x2 GridLayout:

\image doc/AxesGridLayout.svg

In QML, this would be expressed as:

\qml
    import QtQuick.Layouts as QQL
    import QuickGraphLib as QuickGraphLib

    QQL.GridLayout {
        columns: 2

        QuickGraphLib.Axis { ... }
        QuickGraphLib.GraphArea { ... }
        Item {} // A filler item for the empty cell
        QuickGraphLib.Axis { ... }
    }
\endqml

QuickGraphLib provides two important types in this example:

\list
    \li \l Axis, which draws an axis (a left and bottom axis in this example)
    \li \l GraphArea, which provides an area to draw data, like line graphs
\endlist

This grid structure is very flexible: for example, if you wanted to place an axis on the top and right as well, the GridLayout can be expanded to a 3x3 grid. Or if you could add more columns or rows to add subgraphs.

\section1 Graphing area contents

Once we have a GraphArea, we can add graph items to it. The example above has a grid, a line graph and a legend:

\qml
    import QuickGraphLib.GraphItems as QGLGraphItems

    QuickGraphLib.GraphArea {
        QGLGraphItems.Grid { ... }
        QGLGraphItems.Line { ... }
        QGLGraphItems.BasicLegend { ... }
    }
\endqml

Each graph item is a QML component, with a set of properties to control it's position or data and how it is drawn.

\section1 Understanding the data transform

One of the most important properties of a GraphArea is \c dataTransform. It must be passed to all of the graph items used, as well as any axes used:

\qml

    QQL.GridLayout {
        QuickGraphLib.GraphArea {
            id: grapharea

            viewRect: Qt.rect(-20, -1.1, 760, 2.2)

            QGLGraphItems.Line {
                dataTransform: grapharea.dataTransform
            }
        }
        QuickGraphLib.Axis {
            dataTransform: grapharea.dataTransform
        }
    }
\endqml

The \c dataTransform is a matrix4x4 which encodes the transformation from data coordinates (which can be any unit, like degrees) to pixel coordinates relative to the GraphArea. To be precise, \c dataTransform is a \l {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation} {affine transformation} consisting of a scaling and translation. To convert any x/y data coordinate to pixels, just do:

\qml
    grapharea.dataTransform.map(Qt.point(dataX, dataY))
\endqml

You can also transform from pixels back to data coordinates by inverting the transform:

\qml
    grapharea.dataTransform.inverted().map(Qt.point(mouseX, mouseY))
\endqml

The \c dataTransform matrix is used by graph items and axes to convert any position/data you give them into pixel positions for drawing. You can also make your own graph items using the \c dataTransform.

\section1 Configuring an axis (and grid)

An Axis has a few properties you must set:

\list
    \li \c dataTransform - this must be set to the \c dataTransform of the graph area the axis is for (there may be multiple graphareas)
    \li \c direction - this must be set to one of \c Left, \c Right, \c Top or \c Bottom, depending on which side of the graph area the axis is
    \li \c ticks - this must be set to a list of tick positions (which may be empty)
\endlist

There are a few options for generating tick positions. The most automatic option is to use \c tickLocator:

\qml
    ticks: QuickGraphLib.Helpers.tickLocator(-20, 740, 11)
\endqml

This will find up to 11 nice positions between -20 and 740. You can specify the spacing etc. manually using \c linspace:

\qml
    ticks: QuickGraphLib.Helpers.linspace(0, 720, 9)
\endqml

This function works the same way as numpy's function of the same name. It will generate 9 positions between 0 and 720 inclusive. And finally, since this is just a list, you can specify ticks using any JavaScript expression you want:

\qml
    ticks: [0, 100, 700]
\endqml

Tick positions are also important for grids, normally you can just feed in the ticks from the axes into the grid:

\qml
    QGLGraphItems.Grid {
        dataTransform: grapharea.dataTransform
        xTicks: xAxis.ticks
        yTicks: yAxis.ticks
    }
\endqml
